    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const players2 = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // players[3] = "Anastasia";

    // now here is the problem!

    console.log(players, players2);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const players3 = Array.from(players);
    players3[3] = "Cosmo";
    console.log(players3, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players4 = [].concat(players);
    players4[3] = "Mama Kitty";
    console.log(players4, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5 = [...players];
    players5[3] = "Mr Ruff";
    console.log(players5, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const samePerson = person;
    // samePerson.name = "Homer Simpson";
    console.log(samePerson, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const differentPerson = Object.assign({}, person);
    differentPerson.name = "Homer Simpson";
    console.log(differentPerson, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Dirty way of deep copying (not recommended due to memory usage)
    const person2 = {name: "Ana",
    age: 72,
    location: {
      city: "Fountain Valley",
      state: "CA"
    }};
    const dirtyCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person2));
    dirtyCopy.location.city = "Westminster";
    console.log(person2, dirtyCopy);
